# Pixel Territory
A 2D scala multiplayer game where players compete to claim as much territory as possible on a grid-based map.
Players move their character around the map, leaving behind a trail that fills in the area they cover.
The goal is to capture territory while defending against other players trying to do the same.

However, if another player runs into your trail, you lose a life and the territory you've captured is lost.
This adds an element of risk as players must balance expanding their territory with avoiding confrontation.
